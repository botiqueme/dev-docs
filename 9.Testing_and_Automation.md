# Testing and Automation

Testing is critical for ensuring the reliability and security of API endpoints. This guide covers how to test API endpoints using **pytest** in Flask and how to set up Continuous Integration (CI) for automated testing.

**Objective**: Test API endpoints using unit and integration tests in Flask and automate these tests using CI tools like **GitHub Actions**.

## Prerequisites
- **pytest**: Install with `pip install pytest`.
- **Flask-Testing** (optional for additional utilities): `pip install Flask-Testing`.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Setting Up Testing Configuration
Configure your Flask app for testing:

```python
import pytest
from myapp import app  # Import your Flask app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    app.config['TESTING'] = True
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client
```

**Explanation**:
- The fixture `client` sets up the app for testing, creating a test client to simulate API requests.

### 2. Writing Unit Tests for API Endpoints
Write tests for individual endpoints using the test client:

```python
def test_get_properties(client):
    response = client.get('/v1/properties')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json == {"properties": []}
```

**Explanation**:
- This test checks if the `/v1/properties` endpoint returns a 200 status code and the expected response.

### 3. Testing Authentication and Authorization
Validate that protected endpoints enforce authentication:

```python
def test_protected_resource_without_token(client):
    response = client.get('/api/protected')
    assert response.status_code == 401
    assert response.json["msg"] == "Unauthorized"

def test_protected_resource_with_token(client):
    # Simulate logging in and obtaining a token
    login_response = client.post('/users/login', json={"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password"})
    token = login_response.json["access_token"]
    response = client.get('/api/protected', headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json["msg"] == "This is a protected resource"
```

**Explanation**:
- The first test ensures access is denied without a token, while the second test verifies access with a valid token.

### 4. Integration Testing: Testing Flows
Test complete flows, like registering a user and accessing their profile:

```python
def test_user_registration_and_profile(client):
    # Register a new user
    response = client.post('/users/register', json={"email": "newuser@example.com", "password": "password123"})
    assert response.status_code == 201

    # Log in with the new user
    login_response = client.post('/users/login', json={"email": "newuser@example.com", "password": "password123"})
    assert login_response.status_code == 200
    token = login_response.json["access_token"]

    # Access the user profile
    profile_response = client.get('/users/profile', headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
    assert profile_response.status_code == 200
    assert profile_response.json["email"] == "newuser@example.com"
```

**Explanation**:
- This integration test simulates registering, logging in, and accessing a profile, ensuring the full flow works correctly.

### 5. Setting Up Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions
Automate tests to run on every code push or pull request:

1. **Create a `.github/workflows/test.yml` file**:
   ```yaml
   name: Run Tests

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v2
           with:
             python-version: '3.8'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install -r requirements.txt
         - name: Run tests
           run: pytest
   ```

**Explanation**:
- This configuration runs tests automatically on every push or pull request, ensuring code quality and preventing issues from reaching production.

### 6. Mocking External Dependencies
Use **unittest.mock** to mock external services (e.g., payment APIs) in tests:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

@patch('myapp.external_service.call_api')
def test_external_service(mock_call_api, client):
    mock_call_api.return_value = {"status": "success"}
    response = client.post('/external/call')
    assert response.json["status"] == "success"
```

**Explanation**:
- Mocking allows you to test functionality without relying on external services, improving test reliability.

### 7. Common Pitfalls
- **Skipping Edge Cases**: Always test edge cases like invalid inputs and expired tokens.
- **Not Running Tests Locally**: Ensure tests run successfully locally before pushing code.

## Further Exploration
To go deeper, explore **Flask-Testing** for more utilities and **pytest-cov** for test coverage reports.

By following these steps, you can set up a comprehensive testing and automation system for your Flask API, ensuring that all endpoints are reliable and secure.
