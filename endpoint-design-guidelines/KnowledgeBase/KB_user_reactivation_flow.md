### **How the Reactivation Flow Works in Practice**
1. **User Attempts to Log In**  
   - The user enters their **email and password** on the login page.
   - The system **checks `is_active`**:
     - If `is_active = True`: Login proceeds as normal.
     - If `is_active = False`: The system **blocks login** and informs the user:  
       _"Your account is inactive. Would you like to reactivate it?"_
   
2. **User Requests Reactivation**  
   - If the user confirms, they are directed to the **`/reactivate_user`** endpoint.
   - The request requires **email verification** before proceeding.

3. **Verification via Email Link**  
   - A **one-time verification link** is sent to the user’s email.
   - The link contains a token (like email verification) to confirm the user wants to reactivate.

4. **User Clicks the Link**  
   - The link redirects to the frontend, which calls the **`/reactivate_user`** endpoint with the token.

5. **Reactivation Processing**  
   - The backend verifies the token.
   - If valid:
     - The **user's `is_active` is set to `True`**.
     - The user **can now log in**.
   - If invalid or expired:
     - The system rejects the request and asks the user to request another reactivation link.

6. **User Logs in Again**  
   - The user can now log in and access their data.
   - **However, subscriptions are not restored** (they must repurchase a plan).

### **Key Implementation Considerations**
✅ **Reactivation should be self-service** (no admin approval required).  
✅ **A security check is needed** to ensure only the account owner can reactivate (via email verification).  
✅ **Inactive users should NOT be able to log in directly**—they must reactivate first.  
✅ **Reactivation does NOT restore chatbot functionality**—users must **purchase a new subscription** after reactivation.

### **How the Endpoint Fits in the Flow**
1. **User logs in** → Blocked due to inactivity  
2. **User clicks "Reactivate my account"** → `/reactivate_user` is called  
3. **Email verification is required** → A verification link is sent  
4. **User clicks the link** → `/reactivate_user` verifies and reactivates  
5. **User can now log in**

### **Next Steps**
1️⃣ **Implement the `/reactivate_user` endpoint** with email verification.  
2️⃣ **Ensure inactive users cannot access the platform** without reactivation.  
3️⃣ **Update the login flow to guide users through reactivation when needed.**  

Does this reactivation process work for your platform? Would you like to adjust any steps?
